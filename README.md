## Projects
### [Robo Game Code Parser](https://github.com/NiamhFerns/course-work/tree/all/COMP-261/RoboGame)
This was a fairly large assignment I completed as part of my Computer Science 261 course at Victoria University of Wellington.

We were tasked with implementing and completing a basic language parser and interpreter for a custom language we could use to control the robots in game. For this project I differed a fair amount from the 
example code that we were provided as I wanted more of a challenge and saw some issues with the example code. I tried my best to make use of patterns I've learned in Software Engineering 225.

### [Wellington Transport Route Finder](https://github.com/NiamhFerns/course-work/tree/all/COMP-261/WellingtonTransport)
A simple implementation of A*, Kosaraju's, and an articulation point finding algorithm. The point of this one was, given the publically available transport network data given by metlink in Wellington,
find efficient paths for people to make it through the city.

I had a lot of fun with this one in particular but am a little sad it had to be in Java. I feel like C#, Rust, Go, or Python would have been a better language for this particular task. 

One of the questions we were asked that I didn't have time to implement was to make the graph work for taking into account switching lines and finding a *realistic* path that isn't naive. This is something I'd loved to
have had time for.

### [Simple Server](https://github.com/NiamhFerns/course-work/tree/all/NWEN-241/assignment-3)
This was a simple implementation of a multi-process server done in C for my Network Engineering 241 course. I had a good amount of fun with this one too. Not super complicated but I thought it was neet.

### [Chip's Challenge](https://github.com/NiamhFerns/course-work/tree/all/SWEN-225/chips_challenge)
This was a major group work project where myself and 5 other students were given a few weeks to fully implement the Chip's Challenge game from scratch. The group work aspect for this one in particular was a fair challenge 
as given this was a bigger project, I got a taste of developing something at a graeter scale than what is common at University. 

I was responsible for the App module in this assignment (that is, the View part in the M.V.C pattern). Working with Swing was... an experience but it was definitely a challenge I enjoyed.

### [k.N.N Wine Classifier](https://github.com/NiamhFerns/course-work/tree/all/COMP-307/assignment-1/wine_classifier)
I did unfortunately have to drop this course due to some circumstances in my personal life but this was an assigment I was very proud of from it. We were tasked with implementing a k.N.N classifier in a language of our choice. 
I chose Rust as I'd never worked with it before and wanted a bit of a challenge and in the end, found my favourite language. Now I'm just sad I don't get a chance to use it more.

If I could redo this one I think I'd have made more use of Rust's testing features as those are both very easy to use and would have saved me a lot of time.

### [Neovim Config](https://github.com/NiamhFerns/nvim)
Not so much an assigment as it is a little hobby, but i'm very proud of my nvim config. Heavy inspiration taken from [Chris Chiarulli's](https://github.com/ChristianChiarulli) basic IDE config. I've molded it around my needs 
and now it's my little baby.

### [Sesh.nvim](https://github.com/NiamhFerns/sesh.nvim)
One that I have yet to make some significant progress on given time constraints but this is my current next big project. I'm not super happy with how current plugins handle sessions in Neovim and feel like I lose a lot of time
just getting stuff set up every morning. So... I'm fixing it. 

Sesh.nvim should automatically restore sessions based on your project (as handled by project.nvim) and give you the option for global sessions.
